Hi,
this page should provide a list of guidance notes on Github.

In short, there is two ways that are valuable for using Github.


1) It's a great way to save your code as a 'CV/resume' for your code.



2) Code sharing/syncing
Remember how during the CodeLikeAGirl week, we used Google Drive to make sure everyone in the team had the same files? Github enables a 
similar concept, however with additional benefits.
The benefits are:
- shared files between multiple users
- the ability to update files, and keep a record/log of the previous states of files allowing you to un-do work if an error is made.
- the ability to 'branch' code. In that sense, take a file in a certain state and then create a duplicate that you can then modify.
